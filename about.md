## Who We Are

MavFi Foundation is a nonprofit that is currently being established to provide free and powerful services to all hardware and software developers that can be used to learn and gain real-world experience with the latest tools, techniques, and technologies. The foundation hopes to help connect developers in a way that inspires collaboration, knowledge sharing, and learning from each other by using the open source model as a tool for learning and gaining experience. As a result, the foundation will also provide the public with free software and free hardware designs.

## Why We Were Created

Hardware and software development is an ever changing, fast paced, and competitive industry. The learning curve associated with adopting new tools, techniques, and technologies can often be a significant deterrent to adoption. As a result, many companies, and the developers that work for them, struggle to keep up and often miss out on the advantages these newer tools, techniques, and technologies have to offer. 

MavFi Foundation was created to provide a collaborative environment where developers can learn from each other and to provide developers with free training and opportunities to gain hands-on real-world experience with the latest tools, techniques, and technologies. With these new skills and experiences, developers are better equipped to help the organizations they work for adopt new tools, techniques, or technologies.
